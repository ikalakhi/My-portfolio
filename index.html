                <p class="subtitle">Web programming refers to the writing, markup and coding involved in Web development, which includes
                    Web content, Web client and server scripting and network security. The most common languages used for Web
                    programming are XML, HTML, JavaScript, Perl 5 and PHP.

                <h4>What is Web development?</h4>
                <p>Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating, building, and
                    maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It may, however, also include web design,
                    web programming, and database management.
                </p>
                <p>Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of apps (web design). The
                    term development is usually reserved for the actual construction of these things (that is to say, the programming of
                    sites).
                </p>
                <p>The basic tools involved in web development are programming languages called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS
                    (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. There are, however, a number of other programs used to “manage” or
                    facilitate the construction of sites that would otherwise have to be done “from scratch” by writing code. A number
                    of content management systems (CMS) fall into this category, including WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, TYPO3, and Adobe
                    Experience Manager, among others.
                </p>
                <h4>Coding daily, Coding all the time!</h4>
                <p>"Coding daily, coding all the time!" expresses a strong dedication to coding and programming. It reflects the
                    enthusiasm of someone who is deeply committed to their work or hobby in the field of coding and software
                    development. Many programmers and developers indeed spend a significant amount of their time coding and honing their
                    skills to become proficient or to work on various projects.
                </p>
                <p>While dedication and practice are essential for becoming a skilled coder, it's also important to strike a balance to
                    prevent burnout and maintain a healthy lifestyle. It's crucial to take breaks, rest, and engage in other activities
                    to avoid excessive stress and ensure long-term productivity and well-being.
                </p>
                <blockquote>"Coding daily, coding all the time, is the path to mastering the language of computers and unlocking the door
                    to endless possibilities in the digital world." &mdash; ChatGPT
                </blockquote>
                <p>Coding every day can be a valuable and productive practice for those who are passionate about programming and want to
                    excel in the field

            <p>
                I am Imran KALAKHI, an ex-1337 future is loading student. 
                My transformative journey at 42 Network's Campus (1337) was a crucible for 
                refining my coding abilities, problem-solving skills, and collaboration capabilities. 
                The immersive, hands-on, project-based curriculum, underscored by peer-to-peer learning 
                and self-directed projects, enabled me to seize control of my educational trajectory. 
                This experience propelled me to delve into the intricate domains of software development 
                and network administration. In the last six months, my focus on web development has led me 
                to master languages such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and explore frameworks like Express for
                 the backend and React.js for the frontend. This evolving journey reflects my unwavering commitment
                  to continual growth and exploration in the ever-expanding landscape of technology.

                <p>Clean blog is a web application where I contacted the backend
                    that allows users to create an account, publish blog posts and
                    customize them with the images of their choice. Users can log
                    in and out of their accounts, and their sessions remain active
                    until they decide to terminate them. The project also includes
                    an "About Me" page where the author shares information
                    about himself

                <p>MarioClub is a front-end project that I developed while following

                    dive into the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. It revolves around creating
                     a visually appealing and interactive user interface for a fictional "MarioClub" website.
                      The project aimed to enhance my understanding of web development concepts and improve my 
                      skills in designing and styling web pages.

                <h6>Language/frameworks: C</h6>
                <p>One of the algorithm projects that I have unlocked is called
                    Push_Swap. The idea is simple, You have two stacks called
                    Stack A and Stack B. Stack A receives a random list of
                    unorganized numbers. You need to take the random list of
                    numbers in stack A and sort them so that stack A is organized
                    from smallest to largest. There are only a few movements that
                    you are allowed to use to manipulate the stacks that we are
                    going to call “Actions”. The main goal of this project is to
                    organize the A-stack in as few actions as possible.
